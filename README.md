# Example Project
## This repo is showing an example of a project folder structure using Atomic Design for UX designer students


### Guide for the folders

**src folder,** this is the folder developers will work in. Code in this folder is compiles into the dist folder

**dist folder,** code is compiled into this folder for the browser/computer to use. This can also be called a build folder.

**assets folder,** static content like images, video, audio, fonts etc.


### Guide for inside src folder

Once inside the **src folder** you'll see more file and folder structure(s). Not all projects will be organized the same way, however you'll see common patterns like a component folder, a JS folder or JS file(s). Code in this folder will be specific to the environment you are building in (e.g. this example is for a website). This example also shows how Atomic Design could organise the coding parts.

**components folder,** a folder where we can create our components.

**scss folder,** for website css, Scss files will compile into css the browser will undertand.
